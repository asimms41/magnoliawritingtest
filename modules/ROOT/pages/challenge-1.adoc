Instructions for cloning a JIRA issue

== Clone an issue

Sometimes it saves time to clone, or duplicate, an issue instead of starting from scratch.

Cloning automatically copies across certain information from the original issue to a new one, including the *Summary*, *Description*, and other details. You can also choose to copy across additional information, such as attachments, sprint values, and links.

[NOTE]
====
A cloned issue has a new key, e.g. DOC-2678, which means that you can update it without affecting the original issue.
====

To clone an issue:

.  Open the issue that you want to clone.
.  Select ··· *> Clone*.
